# DES-OpenFOAM-Solver
The Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) is performed for flow over sphere. The simulations are carried out based on free-stream Mach number MÂ¥ = 0:2 and sphere diameter D = 1m in sub-critical regime at Re = 10; 000. A cartesian grid is generated using CfMesh in OpenFOAM and computations are performed using PIMPLE Foam solver. For this Reynolds number at near to the equator of the sphere, flow separates laminarly and in the separated shear layer the transition to turbulence occur at certain distance. The frequency spectrum using probes at different locations are computed. The three main instabilities of different frequencies shed from sphere surface namely, the large-scale vortex shedding at St = fvsD=U = 0:203, the Kelvin Helmholtz and a frequency lower than the vortex shedding frequency known a low-frequency which attributes to the shrinkage and enlargement of recirculation bubble. Additionally, turbulence statistics are compared with previous experimental and numerical results available in literature for sub-critical Reynolds number. Specific consideration is dedicated to computing the mean flow statistics and parameters such as mean angular pressure and skin friction coefficient, mean lift and drag coefficient, among others, to validate the solver and turbulence model used.
